### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Bocheng Zhong (é’Ÿä¼¯è¯š)

I am a master's student in the [School of Design](https://designschool.sustech.edu.cn/en) at the [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/), supervised by [Prof. Marcel Zaes SAGESSER](https://soundstudiesgroup.net/marcel-zaes-sagesser) and [Prof. Seungwoo JE](https://www.seungwooje.com/). I earned my B.S. from the [Guangxi University](https://www.gxu.edu.cn/). I'm a Master's student at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), focusing on **human-computer interaction**, **sound perception**, **acoustic feedback**, and **VR-based perceptual design**.  

My research explores how sound can simulate tactile experiences in virtual environments â€” bridging **physical sensing**, **sound design**, and **immersive interaction**.
