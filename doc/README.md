## Hi! I am Yilong Lin.

I am a master's student in the [School of Design](https://designschool.sustech.edu.cn/en) at the [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/), supervised by [Prof. Seungwoo JE](https://www.seungwooje.com/). I earned my B.S. from the [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/).

My research in human-computer interaction focuses on the **Haptic Device, Embodiment Illusion, and Body Ownership with virtual reality**.
