## TaBot: Designing an Al-empowered Robotic Table to Promote Balanced Conversational Experiences

### Abstract

TaBot is a robotic table that can sense and interpret the subtle atmosphere of the conversation (e.g., duration
and paces, tone of voice, word choice, and language patterns, etc.) and provide “ambient cues” to the individuals
through non-verbal movements. This work was exhibited at Shenzhen Art Museum (New Venue).
