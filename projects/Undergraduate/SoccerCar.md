### Abstract

For our project, we used the Stm32f4 to create a car that could kick a small ball in a competition. The competition was divided into tracing, kicking, and target detection. To begin, the car had to move to the center of the field without human control. We used a camera and a PID control algorithm to achieve the tracing function. Once the car reached the center of the field, the player could take control and use it to kick the ball towards the opponent's goal. To control the car, we used cell phones and designed a control interface that allowed us to control the car through Bluetooth. We also created a mechanical mechanism to pop the ball out quickly. We also utilized OpenCV to recognize a banana displayed on a screen, giving us control of the goalkeeper for three minutes.
