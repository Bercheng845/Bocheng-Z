I am a master's student in the School of Design at the Southern University of Science and Technology,  supervised by [Prof. Seungwoo JE](https://www.seungwooje.com/). 

My research in human-computer interaction focuses on the **Haptic Device, Embodiment Illusion, and Body Ownership with virtual reality**.

I earned my B.S. from the [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/).
